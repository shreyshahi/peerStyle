%the following command would (if uncommented) allow  only chapter1 and
%chapter2 to be processed
%\includeonly{chapter1,chapter2}

% if you feel real savvy use
% \typein{Now put in includeonly}
% the \typein command stops latex at this point and allows you to type
% in a command such as
% \includeonly{chapter3,chapter5}
% this can save some time and means you don't have to edit this file
% as much.

\begin{document}

% first the preface sections.  

% this includes the file preface.tex which should include the
% following commands
% \beforepreface

% the last preface section (e.g., acknowledgement.tex)
